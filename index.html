				<h3>Hello! I'm Aidan, you might know me as Gast2405 which is the online representation of myself. I love 2 things: making games and making movies. In my free time i play a lot of games and watch a lot of movies.</h3> <h3>
			I have most basic programming skills, i can write the following languages: C#, C++, HTML5 and CSS, 6502 assembly, NESFab and Python. </h3> <h3>
			I have also already made 2 small movies: SCP:Ticket to hell and Overprikkeld. </h3> <h3> SCP:Ticket to hell was a small movie made together with my friends in one weekend, we stayed up all night filming this movie and afterwards i spent about a week editing it in premiere. The end result was great and is still my favourite movie of myself.
		</h3>
			<h3> Overprikkeld was a project that i've worked a year on. I was in a filmclub where i and around 9 other students had to make a movie in a year. I was the director of this movie and also the editor. I learned a lot working on this project and it was a lot of fun, we also had proffesionals help us every other week with the movie which was awseome. </h3>
			<h3> I also like small other hobby's like Photoshopping or editing in Premiere. </h3>
